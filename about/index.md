I am **Damon Binder**. I am a graduate student at Princeton, studying theoretical physics. I am a [John Monash scholar](https://johnmonash.com/), and this scholarship helps support my studies.

My main interests are in theoretical physics and its mathematical underpinnings. You can find my papers [here](https://damonbinder.github.io/research/). I also enjoy [coding](https://damonbinder.github.io/projects/) (especially physics simulations), and am an avid reader of history books.

My resume can be found [here](/resume.pdf).
