## The [*N*-Body Problem](/scripts/SM/Gravity.html)?

Newton's law of universal gravitation states that objects attract each other via the inverse square law:

$$F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{R^2}$$

Here $m_1$ and $m_2 are the masses of the objects, $R$ is the distance between the objects, and $G$ is a constant. We can use this rule to predict the motion of stars and planets. For the case of two planets, this motion can be found explicitly, from which we can derive [Kepler's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion) describing orbital motion. When we have three or more planets, the motion becomes chaotic and we cannot solve the problem exactly. This problem is known as the *N*-body problem, and has troubled mathematicians for centuries.


When trying to simulate more than two bodies, we have to use approximate, numerical methods to solve the problem. These are used to study all sorts of physical systems --- the motion of planets around a star, the motion of stars in a galaxy, or the motion of galaxies through the universe. I have made my own [*N*-Body simulation](http://djbinder.com/scripts/NBody/Gravity.html).
