Here is a list of all the papers, essays and notes I've written.





## Semester 1 2017
* [**Notes on Quantum Field Theory**](/documents/QFTNotes.pdf). I have written course notes for an introductory quantum field theory course, aimed at third year undergraduate course at the Australian National University. The aim is to create a course which provides a solid conceptual and computation foundation for undergraduate students, whilst developing the basics of topics in both particle physics and condensed matter theory. The notes cover canonical quantization, path-integrals, Feynman diagrams, fermions, tree-level QED and the basics of spontaneous symmetry breaking.

## Undergraduate

### Honours - 2016
* [**Honours Thesis**](/documents/HonoursThesis.pdf). My honours project studied the emergence of nuclear interaction from higher energy physics. In particular, I was aiming to relate the phenomenological energy density functionals used in nuclear many-body simulations to underlying mesonic physics. My supervisor was [Cedric Simenel](https://physics.anu.edu.au/people/profile.php?ID=709&tab=publications), a nuclear theorist specializing in nuclear dynamics.

* I gave two presentations on my honours thesis. The [mid-year](/documents/MidHonoursTalk.pdf) was delivered after I had completed my preliminary research, and the [final](/documents/FinalHonoursTalk.pdf) was given after my thesis had been written.

* [**Non-Anomalous Semigroups and Real Numbers**](/documents/RealNumbers.pdf). A paper presenting a novel definition of the real numbers, which I wrote as part of a course on category theory. The paper can be found on the arxiv at <https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05997>.

* [**Dark Matter and the Diphoton Excess**](/documents/DiphotonResonance.pdf). Some notes I wrote in January on the 750 GeV diphoton resonance, while I was at Melbourne University. The diphoton resonance now appears to have been a statistical fluctuation, so my notes are no longer useful for anything.


### 2015

* [**The Quantum Zeno Effect**](/documents/QuantumZeno.pdf). In this essay I show that the quantum Zeno effect is non-physical in the sense that any system which can perform the necessary arbitrarily quick measurements requires infinite energy. I wrote this as part of a measurement theory course run by Matt James, which heavily influenced my thinking on the measurement problem.

* I did a reading course on general relativity with Susan Scott. My [**final report**](/documents/GRReport.pdf) was a collation of various tasks I completed through the semester. The most interesting parts are a discussion of the energy conditions in FRW cosmology, and a book review of *Quantum Field Theory: The Why, What and How* by Thanu Padmanabhan. My [**final presentation**](/documents/GRPresentation.pdf) was on the singularity theorems.

* I also did a reading course on quantum field theory with Vladimir Bazhanov. My [**final report**](/documents/WKBReport.pdf) was on higher order corrections to the WKB method, as was my [**final presentation**](/documents/WKBPresentation.pdf).

* My [**PHYS 3033 lab report**](/documents/PHYS3033Lab.pdf), which was on neutron activation analysis. This mainly serves as proof (to myself mostly) that I *can* do labs, and I had a lot of fun automating peak detection and statistical analysis. The most fun part about this was the background peak identification, as I managed to detect both the \\(^{238}\\)U and \\(^{232}\\)Th sequences, along with a few other harder to identify peaks.

* Here are my (terse) notes for [**Algebraic Topology**](/documents/AlgebraicTopologyRN.pdf) and for [**Algebra 3**](/documents/Algebra3RN.pdf) (on Lie algebras and representation theory).

### 2014
* [**Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics**](/documents/SUSYQM.pdf), an essay I wrote for PHYS3001. Pretty much every single solvable model in quantum mechanics can be understood in this framework.

* [**The Ergodic Theorem**](/documents/ErgodicTheorem.pdf), an essay I wrote for Analysis 3. It presents a proof of the Pointwise Ergodic Theorem, and then uses the theorem to prove Borel's Theorem for Normal Numbers as well as the Strong Law of Large Numbers.

* [**Stochastic Simulation of a Two-Level Quantum System**](/documents/OpenQuant1.pdf) and [**Truncated Wigner Simulation of Squeezing in an Anharmonic Oscillator**](/documents/OpenQuant2.pdf). I wrote these as part of an open quantum systems project undertaken with Joseph Hope. My [**final presentation**](/documents/Wigner.pdf) was on Wigner functions.

## High School  (2002-2013)
In years 11 and 12 I studied for the International Baccalaureate, which requires students to write an extended essay on a topic of their choosing. Against pretty much all advice I read I decided to do one in maths. Since I struggled to find good maths extended essays, I have uploaded mine [**here**](/documents/ExtendedEssay.pdf) in the hope it will prove useful to future students (and also to prove you don't *have* to do cryptography as your topic if you do a maths extended essay).
