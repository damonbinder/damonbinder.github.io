Here is a list of all the papers, essays and notes I've written.

## Honours - 2016
* **Non-Anomalous Semigroups and Real Numbers**. A paper presenting a novel definition of the real numbers. I wrote a [blog post](https://damonbinder.github.io/blog/real-numbers/) explaining the basic ideas. The paper can be found on the arxiv at <https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05997>.

* [**Dark Matter and the Diphoton Excess**](/documents/DiphotonResonance.pdf). Some notes I wrote in January on the 750 GeV diphoton resonance. The diphoton resonance now appears to have be a statistical fluctuation, so my notes now stand as a testament to this curious time in particle physics history.

## Undergraduate
### 2015
* [**The Quantum Zeno Effect**](/documents/QuantumZeno.pdf). In this essay I show that the quantum Zeno effect is non-physical in the sense that any system which can perform the necessary arbitrarily quick measurements requires infinite energy. I wrote this as part of a measurement theory course run by Matt James, which heavily influenced my thinking on the measurement problem.

* I did a reading course on general relativity with Susan Scott. My final report can be found [here](/documents/GRReport.pdf). The most interesting parts are a discussion of the energy conditions in FRW cosmology, and a book review of *Quantum Field Theory: The Why, What and How* by Thanu Padmanabhan. The slides for my final presentation, on the singularity theorems, can be found [here](/documents/GRPresentation.pdf).

* I also did a reading course on quantum field theory with Vladimir Bazhanov. My final [report](/documents/WKBReport.pdf) was on higher order corrections to the WKB method, as was my [final presentation](/documents/WKBPresentation.pdf).

* My [lab report](/documents/PHYS3033Lab.pdf), which was on neutron activation analysis. This mainly serves as proof (to myself mostly) that I *can* do labs, and I had a lot of fun automating peak detection and statistical analysis. The most fun part about this was the background peak identification, as I managed to detect both the \\(^238\\)U and \\(^232\\)Th sequences, along with a few other harder to identify peaks.

* Here are my (terse) notes for [Algebraic Topology](/documents/AlgebraicTopologyRN.pdf) and for [Algebra 3](/documents/Algebra3.pdf) (which was on Lie algebras and representation theory).

### 2014
* [**Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics**](/documents/SUSYQM.pdf), an essay I wrote for PHYS3001. Pretty much every single solvable model in quantum mechanics can be understood in this framework.

* [**The Ergodic Theorem**](/documents/ErgodicTheorem.pdf), an essay I wrote for Analysis 3. It presents a proof of the Pointwise Ergodic Theorem, and then uses the theorem to prove Borel's Theorem for Normal Numbers as well as the Strong Law of Large Numbers.

* [**Stochastic Simulation of a Two-Level Quantum System**](/documents/OpenQuant1.pdf) and [**Truncated Wigner Simulation of Squeezing in an Anharmonic Oscillator**](/documents/OpenQuant2.pdf). I wrote these as part of an open quantum systems project undertaken with Joseph Hope. My final presentation was on Wigner functions, the slide can be found [here](/documents/Wigner.pdf).

## High school - 2013
In high school I did the International Baccalaureate system, which requires students to write an extended essay on a topic of their choosing. Since I struggled to find good maths extended essays, I have uploaded mine [here](/documents/ExtendedEssay.pdf) in the hope it will prove useful to future students (and also to prove you don't *have* to do cryptography as your topic).
