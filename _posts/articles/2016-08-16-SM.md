## What is the Ising Model?

The Ising Model, named after [Ernst Ising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Ising), is a simple model that can be used to describe all sort of complicated behaviour. The basic idea is that we have a grid, and at each point on that grid we have an arrow that points either up, or down. We will represent the up arrows by white squares, and the down arrows by black squares. This is a basic model of a magnet: each square in the grid can be thought of as a little bar magnet, with the north side facing either up or down.

The behaviour of the system is governed by three basic principles:

* Arrows want to align with their neighbours

* Heat causes the arrows to flip randomly sometimes --- the higher the temperature, the more likely a flip and the more randomly the system acts

* An external magnetic field makes the arrows favour a direction. The bigger and more positive the magnetic field, the more the arrows want to point up.
