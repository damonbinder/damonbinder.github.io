## What is the Ising Model?

The Ising Model, named after [Ernst Ising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Ising), is a simple model that can be used to describe all sort of complicated behaviour. The basic idea is that we have a grid, and at each point on that grid we have an arrow that points either up, or down. We will represent the up arrows by white squares, and the down arrows by black squares. This is a basic model of a magnet: each square in the grid can be thought of as a little bar magnet, with the north side facing either up or down.

The behaviour of the system is governed by three basic principles:
* Arrows want to align with their neighbours

* Heat causes the arrows to flip randomly --- the higher the temperature, the more likely a flip and the more randomly the system acts

* An external magnetic field makes the arrows favour a direction. The bigger and more positive the magnetic field, the more the arrows want to point up.

I have made a simulation of the two-dimensional Ising Model. You can play around with it [here](/scripts/SM/ising.html) By changing the temperature and the magnetic field, you can see all sorts of interesting behaviour:
* **Phase Transition**: At high temperatures, the grid looks very chaotic, an even mix of white and black squares. Yet as we lower the temperature, we get clusters, regions where every square is black or white. If you leave the simulation long enough, the whole grid will become either black or white. This is a [*phase transition*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_transition), from a state of disorder to a state of order, and is analogous to the liquid-gas phase transition.
*Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking: The Ising Model has a symmetry: if we flip every arrow, changing every black square to a white square and every white square to a black square, then the system is identical. At low temperatures though, we see that the grid divides into regions of all black or all white. These regions are not symmetric when we flip arrows, and so this is known as [*spontaneous symmetry breaking*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking). This phenomenon is important throughout modern physics, and is responsible for both [superconductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superconductivity) and the [Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism).
