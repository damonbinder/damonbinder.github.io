Here are some statistical simulations I have made. I'll add more simulations and more information on them in a bit.


[Here is a simulation of the 2D Ising model.](/scripts/SM/ising.html)

[Here is a lattice gas simulation.](/scripts/SM/LatGas.html)

[Here is a simulation of a 2D magnet with a continuous \\(U(1)\\) symmetry.](/scripts/SM/U1.html)

[Here is a simulation of a 2D magnet with a continuous \\(SO(3)\\) symmetry.](/scripts/SM/SO(3).html)
