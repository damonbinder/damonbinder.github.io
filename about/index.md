I am **Damon Binder**. I am a graduate student at Princeton, studying theoretical physics. I am a [John Monash scholar](https://johnmonash.com/), and this scholarship helps support my studies.

My main interests are in theoretical physics and its mathematical underpinnings. You can read some of my papers and essays [here](https://damonbinder.github.io/writing/). I also enjoy [coding](https://damonbinder.github.io/projects/) (especially physics simulations), and am an avid reader of history books, especially quantitative history.

My CV can be found [here](https://damonbinder.github.io/about/MyCV.pdf).

As you may have noticed, my website is currently still under construction.
