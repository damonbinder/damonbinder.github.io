I am **Damon Binder**. I study physics at the Australian National University, and this year completed my honours year. My [honours project](/documents/HonoursThesis.pdf) was on theoretical nuclear physics, researching into how high-energy physics such as meson exchange can give rise to time-odd and tensor forces in nuclear many-body problems. I am a [John Monash scholar](https://johnmonash.com/), and will use the scholarship to help fund a PhD in theoretical physics.


My main interests are in theoretical physics and its mathematical underpinnings. You can read some of my papers and essays [here](https://damonbinder.github.io/writing/), or scroll through my [blog](https://damonbinder.github.io/blog/) for less formal writing along with the occasional rant. I also enjoy [coding](https://damonbinder.github.io/projects/) (especially physics simulations), and am an avid reader of history books, especially quantitative history.

My CV can be found [here](https://damonbinder.github.io/about/MyCV.pdf).

As you may have noticed, my website is currently still under construction.
