I study conformal field theories. These are a special class of quantum field theories that arise in the study of phase transitions, string theory and particle physics. My dissertation is titled *N=6 Superconformal Field Theories*, and studies conformal field theories in three spacetime dimensions with extended supersymmetry. My advisor is Silviu Pufu, who is a member of the [bootstrap collaboration](https://bootstrapcollaboration.com/).

### Undergraduate

As an undergraduate, I studied at the Australian National University. For my honour year I worked with [Cedric Simenel](https://physics.anu.edu.au/people/profile.php?ID=709&tab=publications), a nuclear theorist specializing in nuclear dynamics.

**Nuclear Interaction from Effective Field Theory**

**Non-Anomalous Semigroups and Real Numbers**  
	An essay I wrote for a category theory course

**The Quantum Zeno Effect**  
	An essay I wrote for a course on quantum measurement  
	[pdf](/documents/QuantumZeno.pdf)

I also wrote [course notes](/documents/QFTNotes.pdf) for an introductory quantum field theory course, aimed at third year undergraduates. The course is now run as [PHYS3201](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/2020/course/PHYS3201).
