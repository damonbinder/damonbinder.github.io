I am **Damon Binder**. I am a graduate student at Princeton, studying theoretical physics. I am a [John Monash scholar](https://johnmonash.com/), and this scholarship helps support my studies.

My main interests are in theoretical physics and its mathematical underpinnings. You can find my papers [here](https://damonbinder.github.io/research/). As a hobby I enjoy [coding](https://damonbinder.github.io/projects/), especially physics simulations. When not doing physics I am an avid reader of history books. I have an interest in Effective Altruism and have signed the *Giving What We Can* pledge.
