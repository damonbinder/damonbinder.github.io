Newton's law of universal gravitation states that planets attract each other via the inverse square law:

$$F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{R^2}$$

We can use this rule to predict the motion of stars and planets. For the case of two planets, this motion can be found explicitly, from which we can derive [Kepler's Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion) describing orbital motion. When we have three or more planets, the motion becomes chaotic and we cannot solve the problem exactly. Instead, we have to use approximate, numerical methods to solve the problem
