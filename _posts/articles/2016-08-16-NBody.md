Here are some N-body simulations I've made. I'll add more simulations and more information on them in a bit.


[Here is a gravity simulation.](/scripts/NBody/Gravity.html)

[Here is a log-gravity simulation. It show how gravity acts in a 2D universe](/scripts/NBody/LogGrav.html)

[Here is a gas simulator. It uses a Lennard-Jones potential to simulate the dynamics of atoms.](/scripts/NBody/LennardJones.html)

[Here is an ion simulator.](/scripts/NBody/Ions.html)
